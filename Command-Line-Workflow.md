For these analyses, we'll be starting with an aligned, trimmed BAM file, [test.bam](https://github.com/andersen-lab/Freyja/raw/main/freyja/data/test.bam). Alignment can be done using a variety of methods, including [minimap2](https://github.com/lh3/minimap2) and [bwa](https://github.com/lh3/bwa). For information on how to perform trimming, check out the [iVar manual](https://andersen-lab.github.io/ivar/html/index.html).
