To run Freyja using a web interface, we recommend using the Terra ecosystem. If you haven't yet used Terra, it's pretty easy to set things up.  You'll need to:
1. Sign up for a Terra account at https://terra.bio/
2. Set up billing: All accounts get $300 in free credits, which is should be more than enough to run the pipeline on a ton of samples
3. Create a workspace, and pull in your desired workflows from dockstore 
4. Load in data and run the pipeline!
