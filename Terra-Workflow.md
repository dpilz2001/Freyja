To run Freyja using a web interface, we recommend using the Terra ecosystem. If you haven't yet used Terra, it's pretty easy to set things up.  You'll need to:
1. Sign up for a Terra account at https://terra.bio/
2. Set up billing: All accounts get $300 in free credit (see [here](https://support.terra.bio/hc/en-us/articles/360046295092), which will allow you to run the pipeline on a ton of samples
3. Create a workspace
4. Select desired method from [dockstore](https://dockstore.org/search?entryType=workflows&search=freyja)
4. Load in data and run the pipeline!
